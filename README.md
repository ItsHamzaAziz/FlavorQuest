# FlavorQuest - Recipe Sharing Web App

## Overview:
This web application allows users to share recipes alongside saving recipes of other users like we save posts on social media platforms. This application involves user authentication and users can share recipes, edit and delete them as well. Each recipe will require an image upload for it as well. In addition to users can apply filters to get specific recipes as well.

## Frontend:
For the frontend part I used HTML, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components and [Tailblocks](https://tailblocks.cc/).

## Backend:
Django framework is used in order to build the backend fot this project.

## Database:
I used SQLite database for this project.

## Primary Key:
Rather than using conventional id, I used uuid (uuid4 more specifically) here.
